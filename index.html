        DESCRIPTION:
        This HTML file is a "Work Meter" application. 
        The application estimates the cost of electricity based on the user's computer power usage, time, and electricity price.

        FEATURES:
        1. User Inputs:
            - Power consumption (in various units such as Watts, Kilowatts, BTU/hour, Horsepower, and Ton). (Not tested)
            - Assumed capacity percentage (to account for partial usage).
            - Electricity price per kWh.

        2. Buttons:
            - "Start" button to begin tracking electricity cost.
            - "Stop" button to halt the tracking process.

        3. Output:
            - Displays the total cost of electricity usage in real-time.
            - Displays the cost per hour based on the provided inputs.

        4. Dynamic Elements:
            - Dropdown for selecting power units.
            - Input fields for power value, capacity percentage, and electricity price.

        5. Timer Functionality:
            - Tracks elapsed time and calculates electricity cost dynamically.
            - Uses `setInterval` to update the cost every 100 milliseconds.

        6. Conversion Functionality:
            - Converts power values to Watts based on the selected unit.

        7. Footer:
            - Displays a footer with attribution: "CC0 2025 - Work Meter by Ellie R".

        NOTES:
        - Default values are provided for power (600 Watts), capacity (100%), and electricity price ($0.15 per kWh).
        - The application assumes 100% capacity usage unless specified otherwise.
        - The cost calculation accounts for the selected power unit and capacity percentage.
        - Conversions have not been tested for all units, but the code is structured to handle them.

        USAGE:
        1. Enter the power consumption value and select the appropriate unit.
        2. Specify the assumed capacity percentage (optional).
        3. Enter the electricity price per kWh.
        4. Click "Start" to begin tracking the cost.
        5. Click "Stop" to halt the tracking process.

        DEPENDENCIES:
        - No external libraries or frameworks are used. The functionality is implemented using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
